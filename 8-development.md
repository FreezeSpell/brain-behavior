# **Brain Development**
## **1. Introduction to Brain Development**
Brain development is influenced by:
- **Genetics** (intrinsic factors).
- **Experience & environment** (extrinsic factors).
- **Hormones & neurotrophic factors**.
This chapter explores:
- **Neural development stages**.
- **How experience shapes the brain**.
- **Critical periods for learning & adaptation**.

# **2. Developmental Frameworks**
### **2.1. Phylogenetic vs. Ontogenetic Development**
| **Type** | **Definition** | **Example** |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Phylogenetic Development** | Evolutionary development of species. | Brain evolution from reptiles to mammals. |
| **Ontogenetic Development** | Development of an individual organism. | From zygote to adult human brain. |

ðŸ“Œ **This course focuses on ontogenetic development.**

# **3. Early Development of the Nervous System**
### **3.1. Embryonic Stages**
| **Stage** | **Timeframe** | **Description** |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Zygote** | Conception â€“ 2 weeks | Single cell divides into multicellular embryo. |
| **Embryo** | 2 â€“ 8 weeks | Basic body structure and nervous system form. |
| **Fetus** | 9 weeks â€“ birth | Brain growth, movement, and sensory development. |

ðŸ“Œ **Embryos of different species resemble each other more than their adult forms.**
### **3.2. Formation of the Neural Tube**
- **Neural tube = precursor to the CNS** (brain & spinal cord).
- **Defects**: Failure to close â†’ **Spina bifida** (incomplete spinal cord).
- **Closure completes by week 4 of gestation**.

# **4. Origin of Brain Cells**
### **4.1. Neural Stem Cells**
| **Cell Type** | **Function** |
|--------------|------------|
| **Neural Stem Cells** | Self-renewing, multipotent precursors. |
| **Progenitor Cells** | Limited differentiation potential. |
| **Neuroblasts / Glioblasts** | Precursors to neurons and glial cells. |

ðŸ“Œ **Neural stem cells remain active in specific brain regions (e.g., hippocampus).**
### **4.2. Genetic & Chemical Influence on Cell Development**
- **Neurotrophic factors** (growth chemicals) regulate differentiation.
- **Gene expression** (turning genes on/off) directs specialization.
- **Epigenetics**: Environmental factors influence gene activity.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: **Prenatal stress increases gene expression by ~10%**.

# **5. Stages of Brain Development**
ðŸ“Œ **Memorize Table 8-1 & Fig. 8.9 (p.255).**

| **Stage** | **Timeframe** | **Process** |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **1. Neurogenesis** | 0 â€“ 25 weeks | Birth of neurons from stem cells. |
| **2. Cell Migration** | 8 â€“ 29 weeks | Neurons travel to final locations. |
| **3. Differentiation** | 8 weeks â€“ birth | Neurons specialize in function. |
| **4. Neural Maturation** | 20 weeks â€“ adolescence | Dendrites & axons grow. |
| **5. Synaptogenesis** | 5 months â€“ early adulthood | Formation of synapses. |
| **6. Apoptosis & Synaptic Pruning** | Birth â€“ adolescence | Unnecessary neurons/synapses removed. |
| **7. Myelination (Myelogenesis)** | Birth â€“ adulthood | Axons become insulated for faster signaling. |

# **6. Key Processes in Neural Development**
### **6.1. Neurogenesis**
- **Neuron production is mostly complete by 25 weeks.**
- **Exception**: **Hippocampus** (new neurons throughout life).
- **Brain tumors**:
  - **Adults**: Glial cell origin (**glioblastoma**).
  - **Children**: Can arise from neurons (**neuroblastoma**).
### **6.2. Neural Migration**
- **Neurons travel via radial glial cells** from **subventricular zone â†’ cortex**.
- **Cortical development follows an "inside-out" pattern**:
  - **Deep layers (VI, V) form first**.
  - **Superficial layers (IV, III, II) form last**.

ðŸ“Œ **Some neurons take alternative paths via chemical signals ("off-road" migration).**
### **6.3. Cell Differentiation**
- **Neurons become functionally specialized based on their location**.
- **Influenced by neurotrophic factors** from surrounding cells.
- **Differentiation completes at birth, but maturation continues for years**.

ðŸ“Œ **Neural plasticity = Ability to change based on experience.**
### **6.4. Neural Maturation**
| **Process** | **Timeframe** | **Function** |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Dendritic Growth** | Prenatal â€“ 2 years | Expands receptive area of neurons. |
| **Axonal Growth** | Prenatal â€“ early adulthood | Connects neurons to targets. |

ðŸ“Œ **Axon growth is guided by neurotrophic chemicals (attraction/repulsion signals).**

# **7. Synaptogenesis & Pruning**
### **7.1. Formation of Synapses**
- **Explosive synaptic growth occurs after birth**.
- **Visual cortex synapse density doubles between 2â€“4 months**.

ðŸ“Œ **Not all synapses are functionally necessary (e.g., synesthesia may arise from excess connectivity).**
### **7.2. Synaptic Pruning & Cell Death**
- **Apoptosis** = Programmed neuron death.
- **Synaptic pruning** = **Elimination of unused synapses**.
  - **Up to 42% of cortical synapses are pruned**.
- **Excessive or deficient pruning is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders** (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorder).

ðŸ“Œ **Pruning continues into adolescence and is influenced by environment and experience.**

---
# **8. Myelination & Brain Maturation**
- **Myelination correlates with cognitive development.**
- **Gray matter decreases (pruning), white matter increases (myelination).**
- **Regions related to language increase gray matter.**

ðŸ“Œ **Intelligence correlates with connectivity in the "default mode network" (highly myelinated regions).**

---
# **9. Environmental & Hormonal Influences on Brain Development**
### **9.1. Enrichment and Brain Plasticity**
- **Complex environments increase synapse number**.
- **Sensory stimulation strengthens neural circuits**.

ðŸ“Œ **Enriched environments enhance cognitive abilities.**
### **9.2. Hormonal Influence**
| **Hormone Type** | **Function** |
|----------------|------------|
| **Androgens (Testosterone)** | Develop male traits, influence brain structure. |
| **Estrogens (Estradiol, Estrone, Estriol)** | Regulate female reproductive functions. |

ðŸ“Œ **Sex hormones alter neuron number, dendrite growth, and synapse formation.**

---
# **10. Experience & Critical Periods**
### **10.1. Chemoaffinity Hypothesis**
- **Axons seek out specific chemical signals in their target regions**.
- **Experience fine-tunes neural connections postnatally**.
- **"Cells that fire together, wire together."**

ðŸ“Œ **Early experiences shape long-term neural connectivity.**
### **10.2. Critical Periods in Development**
- **Certain skills (e.g., language, vision) require early exposure to stimuli.**
- **Missed critical periods lead to permanent deficits.**

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: **Children born with cataracts need early surgery to develop normal vision.**

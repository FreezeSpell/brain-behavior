# **Measuring and Manipulating Brain and Behavior**
## **1. Introduction to Brain Research Techniques**
Understanding brain function requires both **measuring** and **manipulating** neural activity. This chapter covers:
- **Postmortem and neuropsychological testing** (lesion studies).
- **Brain stimulation techniques** (DBS, TMS).
- **Electrical activity recording** (EEG, MEG).
- **Anatomical imaging** (CT, MRI, DTI).
- **Functional imaging** (fMRI, PET, fNIRS).

# **2. Studying the Effects of Brain Lesions**
### **2.1. Postmortem Examination**
- Examining brains of patients with known neurological disorders (e.g., **stroke, tumors**).
- **Types of strokes**:
  - **Ischemic stroke** â†’ Blocked blood vessel.
  - **Hemorrhagic stroke** â†’ Burst blood vessel.
ðŸ“Œ **Lesion studies provide insight into structure-function relationships but lack experimental control.**
### **2.2. Neuropsychological Testing**
- **Used in clinical neuropsychology** (e.g., memory tests in Alzheimer's patients).
- Helps **localize brain damage**.
ðŸ“Œ **More details covered in â€˜Neuropsychological Assessmentâ€™ (2nd-year major in Clinical Neuropsychology).**

# **3. Techniques for Manipulating Brain Activity**
### **3.1. Psychosurgery**
- **Stereotaxic apparatus** â†’ Targets specific brain areas for:
  - **Ablation (lesioning).**
  - **Gamma knife radiation.**
  - **Deep brain stimulation (DBS).**
#### **Types of Lesions**
| **Type** | **Method** | **Reversibility** |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Electrolytic** | Electrical current burns tissue. | **Permanent** |
| **Neurotoxic** | Injecting neuron-killing chemicals. | **Permanent** |
| **HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound)** | Heat destroys neurons. | **Permanent** |
| **Cooling (Cryogenic Lesion)** | Temporarily inactivates neurons. | **Reversible** |
| **GABA Agonist Injection** | Inhibits activity in targeted regions. | **Reversible** |

ðŸ“Œ **Lesion studies reveal function, but the brain may compensate through neuroplasticity.**

# **4. Brain Stimulation Techniques**
### **4.1. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)**
- **Electrodes implanted in the brain** deliver continuous low-voltage pulses.
- **Used for**:
  - **Parkinsonâ€™s disease** (targets **basal ganglia**).
  - **Depression, OCD** (targets **limbic system**).
ðŸ“Œ **DBS can modulate neural activity without permanent damage.**
### **4.2. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)**
- **Magnetic pulses stimulate brain areas non-invasively**.
- **Applications**:
  - Temporary "virtual lesions" to test brain function.
  - Treating **depression** (stimulates the **left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex**).
ðŸ“Œ **TMS is non-invasive but has limited depth penetration.**

# **5. Measuring Electrical Activity in the Brain**
### **5.1. Single-Cell Recording**
- **Records action potentials from a single neuron**.
- Used in **animal studies** and for **mapping sensory areas**.
ðŸ“Œ **Best for studying specific neuron functions but requires surgery in living animals.**
### **5.2. Electroencephalography (EEG)**
- **Measures summed graded potentials (EPSPs & IPSPs) from many neurons**.
- **High temporal resolution (~1 ms)** but **poor spatial resolution (~1 cm)**.
ðŸ“Œ **Inexpensive and non-invasive, but cannot localize activity precisely.**
#### **Why Canâ€™t EEG Measure Action Potentials?**
- **Action potentials are too brief and asynchronous**.
- **EEG reflects postsynaptic potentials, which last longer**.
### **5.3. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)**
- **EEG signals averaged over repeated trials** to identify brain responses to specific stimuli.
- Used to study **sensory processing, attention, and cognitive function**.
ðŸ“Œ **ERPs help identify brain responses but require many trials to extract signals.**
### **5.4. Magnetoencephalography (MEG)**
- **Records magnetic fields generated by brain activity**.
- **Higher spatial resolution (~2-3 mm)** than EEG.
- **More expensive but less signal distortion**.
ðŸ“Œ **MEG is better than EEG for precise localization but requires a shielded room.**

# **6. Anatomical Imaging Techniques**
### **6.1. Computed Tomography (CT)**
- **X-ray scans create a 3D image of the brain**.
- **High spatial resolution (~1 mm)** but **low temporal resolution (~1 sec)**.
ðŸ“Œ **Used for detecting strokes, tumors, and bone fractures but lacks fine neural detail.**
### **6.2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**
- **Uses magnetic fields to image hydrogen atoms in the brain**.
- **Better spatial resolution than CT (~1-5 mm)**.
- **Can distinguish gray and white matter**.
ðŸ“Œ **MRI is ideal for soft tissue imaging but requires lying motionless for 20-40 minutes.**
### **6.3. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)**
- **Measures movement of water molecules in axons**.
- **Creates images of nerve fiber tracts** (e.g., detecting **myelin loss in MS**).
ðŸ“Œ **DTI helps map brain connectivity but does not show functional activity.**
### **6.4. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)**
- **MRI method focusing on blood vessels**.
- **Used to detect aneurysms and vascular blockages.**
---
# **7. Functional Brain Imaging Techniques**
### **7.1. Functional MRI (fMRI)**
- **Measures changes in blood oxygenation (BOLD signal)**.
- **Good spatial resolution (~1-5 mm)** but **low temporal resolution (~10 sec)**.
ðŸ“Œ **fMRI tracks brain activity indirectly via blood flow but is slow.**
### **7.2. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)**
- **Uses infrared light to measure blood oxygen levels in the cortex**.
- **Good temporal resolution (~100 ms), moderate spatial resolution (~1 cm)**.
ðŸ“Œ **Non-invasive and cheaper than fMRI but limited to surface layers (~2 cm deep).**
### **7.3. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)**
- **Injects radioactive tracers to measure glucose, oxygen, or neurotransmitter activity**.
- **Moderate spatial resolution (~4-6 mm), very slow temporal resolution (~2 min)**.
ðŸ“Œ **Expensive due to radiochemical preparation, often combined with fMRI or CT.**

# **8. Combining Brain Imaging Methods**
### **8.1. EEG + fNIRS**
- **Combines EEGâ€™s high temporal resolution with fNIRSâ€™s moderate spatial resolution**.
- **Limitation**: Only measures **superficial cortex (~2 cm deep).**
### **8.2. EEG + fMRI**
- **Combines EEGâ€™s fast timing with fMRIâ€™s detailed spatial imaging**.
- **Limitation**: Requires MRI-compatible EEG equipment.

# **9. Summary of Brain Research Techniques**
| **Method** | **Spatial Resolution** | **Temporal Resolution** | **Invasiveness** |
|------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **EEG** | Poor (~1 cm) | Excellent (~1 ms) | Non-invasive |
| **MEG** | Good (~2-3 mm) | Excellent (~1 ms) | Non-invasive |
| **CT** | High (~1 mm) | Poor (~1 sec) | X-ray radiation |
| **MRI** | High (~1-5 mm) | Poor (~1-4 sec) | Non-invasive |
| **fMRI** | High (~1-5 mm) | Poor (~10 sec) | Non-invasive |
| **PET** | Moderate (~4-6 mm) | Very poor (~2 min) | Radioactive tracers |

ðŸ“Œ **Brain imaging techniques differ in resolution, speed, and invasiveness.**
